console.log("numbers.js");

// 1 Create a variable using the let keyword and assign a number to it.

let pizza = 6;
console.log(pizza);

// 2 On a new line, add 15 to your variable

pizza += 15;
console.log(pizza);

// 3 On a new line, subtract 8 from your variable without
// using the variable when calculating the new value
pizza -= 8;
console.log(pizza);

// 4 Calculate the average of 26, 44, 72, 86, 112.
// Assign the calculated average to a new variable.
let avg = (26 + 44 + 72 + 86 + 112) / 5;
console.log(avg);

// 5 Modify the following code so it outputs 15 without adding any new lines of code

let theNumber = 14;
console.log(++theNumber);

// 6 What operator can you use to find out if a variable contains a number?
// typeof number;

// Note: Assignment went well. Similar approaches but similar results.
// Both had trouble with number 3.
